# AI Prompt Hub

A centralized repository for structured, versioned AI prompts designed to optimize development workflows, prototyping, and productivity.  
Each prompt is carefully curated to enforce best practices, modularity, and maintainability.

## Features

- **Versioned Prompts:** Keep track of prompt changes and improvements over time.  
- **Workflow Automation:** Prompts enforce consistent development workflows.  
- **Prototyping Support:** Single-file prototype mode for quick testing.  
- **Reusable Rules:** Clear development, UI/UX, and coding standards.  
- **Strict Guidelines:** Includes do's and don'ts to maintain code quality and structure.

## Usage

1. Browse the repository for the prompt or workflow you need.  
2. Copy the prompt text and provide it to your AI tool.  
3. For prototyping, use the `[PROTOTYPE]` keyword to get a single-file, modular outline.
